When you start working:
  git pull
    Gets the changes that others have made to the project.

When you have made changes to the project that you want to publish:
  git add <files to add. Could be a directory>
    Stages the changes you have made so they will be committed by the next 'git commit'
  git commit -m "<message>"
    Commits the files you added; creates a record of the changes you made.
  git push
    Publishes the changes you made to the git repository.
