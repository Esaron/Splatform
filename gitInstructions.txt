When you start working:
  git pull
    Gets the changes that others have made to the project.

When you have made changes to the project that you want to publish:
  git add <files to add. Could be a directory>
    Stages the changes you have made so they will be committed by the next 'git commit'.
  git commit -m "<message>"
    Commits the files you added; creates a record of the changes you made.
  git push
    Publishes the changes you made to the git repository.

When you want to browse through code history:
  gitk
    Launches a GUI that lets you look through past commits. 
    The top frame in the GUI lists the commits over time, when they were made, and who made them, etc.
    The bottom right frame lists the files that were changed for the commit selected in the top frame.
    The bottom left frame shows the changes that were made for the file selected in the bottom right frame in the commit in the top frame. A line with green text that starts with a '+' means that line was added in that commit. A line with red text that starts with a '-' means that line was removed in that commit. If the lines look the same, it's usually because a small part of that line was changed.
